## Notes on Sequence Data

- **Public Domain:**  
  Although the sequences are in the public domain, we acknowledge that curated databases like RefSeq offer additional quality control. These sequences represent isolates related to the most recent outbreak.
  
- **Limitations and Differences:**  
  - The sequences in this repository are **not** curated RefSeq entries.
  - Some sequences may differ from RefSeq versions due to differences in submission details, sequencing methodologies, or subsequent updates.
  - Users are encouraged to verify sequence details and metadata directly from GenBank if high-level curation is required for their analysis.
  - The pipeline currently supports only the references provided with it.
