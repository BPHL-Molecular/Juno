## Notes on Reference Sequence Data

- **Public Domain:**  
Although the sequences are in the public domain, we recognize that curated databases like RefSeq provide additional quality control and standardized annotations. However, the reference sequences used in this pipeline come from isolates directly related to the [most recent outbreak](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03300-3), making them more representative of the current viral population than the older RefSeq entries.
  
- **Limitations and Differences:**  
  - The sequences in this repository are **not** curated RefSeq entries.
  - Some sequences may differ from RefSeq versions due to differences in submission details, sequencing methodologies, or subsequent updates.
  - Users are encouraged to verify sequence details and metadata directly from GenBank if high-level curation is required for their analysis.
  - The pipeline currently supports only the references provided with it.
